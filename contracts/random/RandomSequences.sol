/**
 * @notice Game contracts that need random numbers should extend this contract.
 * @dev Note that game players will be able to know the next random value for any 
 *      random sequence type. However, they will not be able to change the value.
 *      This type of random generation will be appropriate for many situations, but 
 *      not all situations. The advantage of this type of generation is that
 *      it takes just one transaction per random number whereas RandomValues.sol
 *      takes two transactions per random number.
 * @dev This contract can be used with UPGRADEABLE or NON-UNGRADEABLE contracts.
 *
 * This contract utilises the concept of sequences of random numbers. Games should
 * define all of the types of random number generation they plan to do. They should 
 * assign a separate sequence type id to each type of random number generation. For 
 * example, imagine a game had three uses for random numbers: determining the results
 * of opening an Armour Loot Box, determining the results of opening a Weapon Loot 
 * Box, and determining the value of a Participation Bonus. Each of these types
 * of random numbers needs to have a separate Sequence Type Id: for instance 1, 2, 
 * and 3. 
 * 
 * Using a separate sequence type id for each type of random action is important as
 * game players can exploit sequences that are used for two or more actions. For
 * example, imagine that all three types of random values described above used the 
 * same sequence. A game player could predict the next random value. If this was not
 * going to yeild a good random result for the Armour or the Weapon Loot Boxes, they 
 * would use do the action in the game to ensure the number was used for the 
 * Participation Bonus. They could do this repeatedly, only utilising the random values
 * for Loot Boxes that were advantageous to them.
 *
 * Using a separate sequence type id for each class of random means that even though
 * the game player knows the output come opening a Loot Box ahead of time, they can't 
 * alter the outcome. They could choose to never open the Loot Box, or leave the game
 * and create a new player profile. 
 *
 * An example of when this type of random number generation isn't appropriate is
 * when there is a shared activity. For example, drawing a prize that multiple people 
 * can simultaneously bit on. Using this sequence type random generation process,
 * where savvy game players could predict the random output, and would thus have 
 * an advantage over less savvy players is not appropriate. In this case, use the 
 * RandomValues.sol directly.
